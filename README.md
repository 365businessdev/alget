Custom NuGet feeds can be added to the configuration. The following properties are available:

| Property | Description | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | The name of the feed. | `string` | Yes |
| Url | The URL of the feed. | `string` | Yes |
| API Key | The API key used to authenticate with the private feed. | `string` | No |
| Package ID Schema | Specifies the pattern used to create NuGet package IDs in this feed. Omit this parameter to use default schema `{publisher}.{name}[.symbols].{appId}` | `string` | No |

```json
{
    "365businessdev.alget.nugetFeeds": [
        {
            "name": "My Custom Feed",
            "url": "https://mycustomfeed.com/v3/index.json",
            "packageIDSchema": "{publisher}.{name}.{appId}"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Good to know

### NuGet Package ID Schema

ALGet uses a default schema to process NuGet package IDs. The schema is `{publisher}.{name}[.{countryCode}].symbols.{appId}`. Some ISV partners may use a different schema for their packages. In this case, you can configure a custom schema for the feed. 

> **Note:**<br>The schema must contain the placeholder `{appId}` to allow us to add the package to your app.json file.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.94.0 or higher
- AL Language extension _(recommended)_

## Known Issues

- None ðŸ¥³, unless you find one, then please report it.
